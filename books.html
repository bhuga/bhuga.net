      Here are reviews of most of the books I read. I write them not for you, but
      for me; I find that knowing I will write a review makes me read in a more
      critical, more useful way. Usefully, it leads to being able to put bad books
      down. When I find a major flaw in the first 20 pages, and I know the
      rest of the book is built on bullshit, and I'll have to write about how I
      kept reading it anyway, and I'll feel stupid. I recommend this system.

      Nonetheless, if you're interested, here they are. Sometimes I forget, so this is
      not all of them.
