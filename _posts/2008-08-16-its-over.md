It's over, it's done.  No more hair.  It was a good run, hair, and I'll miss you, but it's time to move on.  

Ben's hair, 1980-2008.  RIP.

The best part is that I could not find a hand mirror to see the back side of my head with, so I bought a comb with one in the handle.  The irony of this did not strike me until I was actually using it.
