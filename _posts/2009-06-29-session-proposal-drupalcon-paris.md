title: "Session Proposal for Drupalcon Paris"
---
I've submitted <a href="http://paris2009.drupalcon.org/session/replacing-your-internal-apps-drupal">my session Proposal for Drupalcon Paris 2009.</a>  After some consternation about the title, I went with 'Replacing your Internal Apps with Drupal'.  I think that's where this hits home--we're replacing an entire backoffice of work-process and communications tools with Drupal, and we think it's great.

This is what we've been doing at Openband for the last few years.  I've written a number of small, internal apps for a lot of small companies over the last few years and I would do them all in Drupal if I could do it all over again.  It's too easy to get data in and out without buying some $20,000 piece of software to link sharepoint and your work-process system.

I gave <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/DrupalconDc2009-PoweringCollaborationInADistributedEnterprise">Openband's presentation at Drupalcon DC 2009</a>, and we got a lot of feedback that what we did was a lot more impressive than the<a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/powering-collaboration-distributed-enterprise"> title and session description</a> gave away.  

This talk will be a bit of a continuation of this topic.  This platform is our baby, and we have a lot to say now that we've started using it internally.  We're hoping to aim this at a slightly broader audience, and hopefully the session description is a bit more attractive this time.  And even if you were at the session last time, we've come a long way in the last 6 months.

Anyways, <a href="http://paris2009.drupalcon.org/session/replacing-your-internal-apps-drupal">go vote for the session!</a>
