title: "Pictures from Marbella"
---
Lets see how long it takes my family to find <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28943956@N08/sets/72157606326698564/">this set of pictures</a> on my website.  Having had several requests for pictures from Marbella, I left 'early' (just before sundown) and took some blurry pictures with my brand-used iPhone, so it's a set of pictures of what I see on my bike ride home.  Since this constitutes absolutely everything I have seen in Marbella, this is completely appropriate.

There were twice as many, but many were too blurry to use.  Also, despite my best efforts with the Flickr uploader, it seems to have put them up backwards.
