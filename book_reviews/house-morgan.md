I didn't finish this book.  I have to give a recommendation either way.

Long story short, it wasn't what I thought it was.  It's a bio of the bank JP Morgan, of a partnership turned corporation.  I thought it was more about the Morgans personally.  It's not bad at what it is, it's just not pulling me in.

I noticed I am not reading anything because I didn't want to read this, and I realized the review was going to be...I don't know.  It's just not exciting and nothing is popping out at me.  So I'm putting it down.
