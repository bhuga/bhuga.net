  <p>
    Ben's a technology generalist who is very refined, respectful, and always professional.
    He goes by
    <span class="dinosaur">bhuga</span>
    on every website that matters, and thinks that's a good enough idea
    that he's done it for years. Google that shit.
  </p>
  <h2>Work</h2>
  <p>
    Ben does programming, operations, and pretty much whatever nerdy needs
    doing.

        The first itch Ben scratched with programming was
        <span class="dinosaur">
          <a href="https://github.com/bhuga/tele-arena-scripts">killing goblins</a>
        </span>

  <h2>Play</h2>
  <p>
    Ben does Kung Fu and loves his little neighborhood, which is the quiet end
    of the French Quarter and the Marigny in New Orleans. He digs the free live
    music. When he leaves there, it's usually to go to the airport to revisit
    Germany or Austria, or somewhere else entirely. Ben bikes everywhere he can.
    Ben does not always watch sports, but when he does,

  <h2>Talk to Ben</h2>
  <p>
    More contact methods than anyone should need are on the right, and you can
    find him as
    <span class="dinosaur">blavender</span>
    on Google's very own email system, which is lots better than he one he used
    to host.

  <h2>Hire Ben</h2>
  <p>
    Ben's
