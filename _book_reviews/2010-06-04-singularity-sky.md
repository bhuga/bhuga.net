Awesome, hilarious.  Stross is becoming one of my favorites.

A bizarre story involving an economic singularity falling upon a communist planet.  It defies description, like the rest of Stross' stuff.

The guy has real vision.  The story starts on a planet with dirt and horses, and by the end there are humanoid bunnies with machine guns verbally sparring with giant mole rats riding around in huts on chicken legs.  Its cool beyond belief.

Accelerando has perhaps not been topped, but it's close.  Awesome in every way.  A short review for a book with nothing bad to say about it.
