A prequel to <i>Collapse</i> and one of my all-time favorites, <i>Guns, Germs and Steel,</i> Diamond here focuses on the evolution of the human species.

While his later books go into greater detail of the evolution of human society, Diamond started at the basics a few years ago with this one.  It's well written and easy to read, with Diamond's typical half-data, half-anecdote style.  I used to have a real problem with this kind of style, but I'm starting to understand that, done right, this is the only way to apply historical perspective.

I'm not sure I would recommend this to be the top of any reading list, as I would GG&S.  Diamond spends a lot of time talking about the evolution of language, for example, and that's a topic explored in much greater detail and with better supporting data by Pinker in <i>The Language Insinct</i>.  Further, the book is already dated, more recent human evolutionary data has settled some arguments that Diamond spends several pages discussing.

The best parts are easily the first-hand experiences of stone-age tribes in New Guinea and how they interact with each other.  Whenever I read Diamond's descriptions of tribes slaughtering each other for wives and hunting grounds, it makes me remember just how ridiculous some modern plans for large-scale social engagement really are, and the resilient community concept has a chance to succeed where other forms of sustainable social organization must inevitably fail.

Diamond writes well, and even recovering some old ground is fun.  I got the book for 33% off and certainly feel like I got my money's worth.
