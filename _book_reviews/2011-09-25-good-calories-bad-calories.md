This changed my life, in all seriousness.

I had no idea how long this was because I had an ebook. Thank god for that. I'm
utterly changed by this. It reads like the exposition of a conspiracy theory.
It's ridiculous how much simply incorrect information I was basing my nutrition
on.

It's all here, a summary of nutrition from the mid-19th century to now. The
answer is always 'carbohydrates are bad', but exactly how bad, and why, has not
been understood until fairly recently. But it's not just obesity. It's
diabetes. It's heart disease. It's cancer. It's everything. And I got told my
whole life that it's calories in, calories out, and that saturated fat is bad
for me, and a bunch of other garbage. Not that the people who told me that knew
differently, or something--it's hard to know what to think when the government
prints flatly incorrect information--but I'm a changed man.

Now, I am completely empowered by information to feel guilty for every beer
ever. Nuts.
