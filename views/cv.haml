      %h4.dinosaur Why do I want to hire Ben?
      Ben's a strong generalist, with focus these days in
      %span.dinosaur Ruby
      and
      %span.dinosaur Coffeescript.
      He's pretty happy coding anywhere in the stack on something he likes, but
      is a little more productive on the backend.
      %br
      Future goals include getting into robotics and hardware. He thinks there's
      going to be a 2000-style bubble in hardware in his lifetime. He'd like to
      get paid to write Go, too.
      %h4.dinosaur How do I know he's any good?!
      %br
      You see the
      %span.dinosaur DINOSAURS?
      %br
      You see the
      %a{:href => 'https://github.com/bhuga'} Github link?
      %br
      You see the
      %a{ :href => "/about"} about page,
      where he says he likes
      %span.dinosaur VIM?
      %br
      %span.huge.dinosaur BUT YOU WANT MORE!?!
    Okay, not everyone's a nerd, so here you go. But if you think that you
    might have a culture clash with someone who makes dinosaur websites and
    doesn't own a pair of dress shoes, I wouldn't worry about it.
    %br
    %br
    If you think that you have something Ben might like to work with you on, his address at gmail is
    %span.dinosaur blavender.
    Drop him a line.

            Germany. In parallel, acted as buildmaster interfacing a 15-man
            development team to a QA team. Also acted as after-hours support to
            interface with German-speaking ISP personnel for the NOC housing the

              Designed and implemented an improved copy of a systems platform
              for a set of web sites to meet high availability requirements.
              Maintained support for this stack while designing other systems.

            %li
              Re-engineered the main software platform running more than 40
              production web sites.  The new design included several features not
              available in the original design, including hardware redundancy,
              high-availability failover, and robust disaster recovery features.
              Developed and successfully implemented a transition plan to
              accompany this design, allowing for per-site outages of less than
              15 minutes for a long-term transition that included driving a truck
              full of servers around Stuttgart.

            %li
              Took responsibility for the routers and firewalls supporting
              the software system, allowing for a much faster turnaround time
              from recognizing a needed change to implementation, increasing the
              development team's ability to experiment with new technologies.

            %li
              Designed and implemented a system to copy existing Drupal web
              sites, a problem not then (nor now) well solved in the Drupal
              community.  This system allowed, for the first time, developers to
              test changes on copies of live sites without affecting production
              environments, allowing for much quicker development of complicated
              components.
